ðŸŒ² Random Forest Regressor for Feature Optimization

This repository showcases the application of a Random Forest Regressor for feature optimization in machine learning tasks. Utilize the model's feature_importances_ attribute for insightful feature importance analysis, perform feature selection to enhance model efficiency, and explore hyperparameter tuning for optimal Random Forest performance. Improve your understanding of influential features and boost the effectiveness of your regression models.
The steps are given below for this project:
Steps:
1. Wireshark was used to create a .pcap file from network traffic. Then this [dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/dosddos-attack-dataset-5g-network-slicing) was created.
2. CICIFlowMeter converted 84 features from a .pcap file to a .csv file.
3. Random Forest Regressor calculated the top features are shown in below:
   ['Flow IAT Mean' 'Bwd IAT Min' 'Pkt Len Max' 'Init Bwd Win Byts']
